# SCP: Containment Procedures

Biggest update has been released - Expansion Update part 2. The development took 2 months and 1 day.

## SCP-938

In September update, I did not mention new SCP in this game - SCP-938!

My adviced for experimenting with them - do not stay too long, or all facility will be doomed.

## New sub zones

Added Surface Zone from Taj mod, since it was open-sourced and is good looking.

Also, Entrance Zone, introduced in 4.0.0, became... more interesting?

## Ragdolls (for humans)

Previously, when health reach 0, a player or NPC will disappear.

In Expansion Update part 2, humans were given ragdolls (except Site Director and SCP-347).

## Interacting rework

Previously, interacting was... not good. Itt only allowed, can NPC follow player, or not.

I reworked interaction to allow new modes - for example, SCP-023 mechanic now uses this system.

# Godot for Windows 7-8.0

Recently, I tested my now-reworked script on Windows 7 machine without updates, and... it not worked, because of old bitsadmin.exe.
The solution is to install updates, I will try next time...
