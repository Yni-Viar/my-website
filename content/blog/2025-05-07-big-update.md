# The return to SCP community (temporary)

The key word is temporary - because nowadays the SCP community is not in good state. Especially post-SCP-4000 entries...

But I am coming with SCP: Unstable Dimension and a future remake of SCP: Containment Procedures.

The first attempt of this game was not good, so with temporary return to SCP community, I decided to remake SCP: Containment Procedures, by using SCP: Unstable Dimension code,
which is more up-to-date, unlike the original game.

# SCP: Unstable Dimension

I finally released my first game. (previous attempts are either incomplate or demo versions)
