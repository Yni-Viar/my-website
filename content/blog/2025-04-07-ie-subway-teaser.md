The subway is actually working (but still may be very laggy ☹️)!
Maybe I will show a proper teaser on my YouTube channel (with passengers, optimization and proper redesign (currently, only the stations are up-to-date, the entry still need for a remade lightmaps, or even meshes, because I made a mistake when modelled them, and make them too large))
