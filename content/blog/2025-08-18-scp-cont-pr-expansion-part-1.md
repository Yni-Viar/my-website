<!-- title: SCP: Containment Procedures Expansion update -->
# Entrance sub-zone
![New zone](./content/images/scp_cont_pr_screen_new_zone_expansion.png)

I added new location - Entrance sub-zone.
It required integrating elevator system into the game, which was easily done.

# Personal offices

In Entrance Sub-zone, there are personal offices - 2 of them are designated to upcoming Story characters (including Protagonist),
and the other 8 are generated from templates. Currently, the only template-based room are designated to game's creator.

Maybe I will set up donation system, and donators will get a chance to receive their own room (not only the developers)

# ⚠️ SCP-347 changes

The exit for SCP-347 has been changed to Maintenance Zone exit (now called Gate B)!!!
Instead a whole Mobile Task Force squad, you'll meet an Agent - a new player class.

# Research Zone lighting revamp.

I recently learned high quality graphics from other SCP games - and Research Zone got updated.

Now it looks like *SCP: Secret Laboratory 13.x* 🙂.

See below on screenshots.

# New sub-site had appeared.

Currently, it is an official game page, where are links for download, information...
It uses Basalt theme, which was used at SCP-Wiki.
