<!-- title: Internal Eternal: July update -->
# Little Update for Demo 1.

This old demo, that was made back in February-March 2025, received an little update.

- Added dialogue icons (present at upcoming Demo 2)
- Switched default renderer to OpenGL ES (due to Godot bug)
- Made game lore up-to-date. (some content was using old lore)
- Small changes from Demo 2.

# Demo 2 development update.

Save system is now working. Actually, there is no checkpoints, where you save, instead it saves, when you switch *a location*.

Locations are separated with loading screens, and in that moment you are saving the game.

(Note, that this screen is Work-in-progress, and may change during the development)

# The story for codename "Internal Eternal" has been recently completed.

For a long time (2022-2025) the story was partly written, partly incomplete and another part was in my head.

Recently, I finished writing the story. Also I fixed some *not-so-good* parts of the story and old lore content, dating back to 2022 (one of this changes even affected my Demo 1, so you see this in a changelog🙂).
