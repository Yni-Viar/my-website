# SCP: Containment Procedures
## 5.2.0 and 5.3.0 came out, adding 3 new SCPs

These are SCP-067 (REAL SCP-067, NOT FAKE FROM MEME!!!), SCP-178 and SCP-446 (in latter update).
Download the game and test these SCP 🙂.

## Added a surprise for December...

... well, not a surprise. It is just a completed Christmas clutter system.

## The future of SCP: Containment Procedures.

Now - sad news 😢...
During development, I felt a little tired, and decided to take a break for developing 6.0.0.

However, 5.x.x will be still developed.

# New directions, new games.

As I got tired from SCP: Containment Procedures, I probably will try new directions in game development using Godot 4 and Unreal Engine 5...

Maybe I could tell about my universe from Internal Eternal (which will wait for now) in smaller games, like SCP: Containment Procedures...
