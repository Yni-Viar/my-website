## SCP Map Generator update

I added checks for room placement, so the large room support is implemented.
(Fun fact - certain amount of large endrooms will always spawn, because it is processing before the rest map generates. The amount of always spawning large endrooms is calculated by this formula: (Size of the zone) / 6)

Also I used Manhattan function for more straight generation (previously, it had some problems with too many corners.)

## ⚠️Important news - SCP project licensing.

### My SCP-related assets relicense.
Since CC-BY-SA 3.0 is not compatible with *anything except other CC licenses*, and CC-BY-SA 4.0 is compatible only with GNU GPL 3, and those licensing have problem with Adaptation meaning,
I relicense my rooms model (and modified statue, that may look like SCP-173) as **CC-BY 4.0** for more wide usage (even for Unreal Engine).
Other SCP-related assets I relicense under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

### SCP: Outrun project relicense.
Continuing the previous topic, I announce relicensing SCP: Outrun under dual license: **GNU GPL 3** for *SCP Foundation* usages, and**MIT License** for *other* usages.
Also, I will *remove* CC-BY-SA 3.0 assets to avoid any trouble. (I already replaced MTF model with recently open-sourced SCP:SL one)

### What about CC0 license for SCP: Outrun, since it is good for code and *actually **is*** a Creative Commons license, so CC-BY-SA 3.0 assets can be used?
I am thinking about it, but cannot decide:
- Pros: Licenses are now compatible, no need to change.
- Cons: This means, that I should also relicense most TGPY projects, used in SCP: Outrun, I am not ready for this... Also how much is right to relicense the **WHOLE** game code under the public domain, just for CC-BY-SA 3 needs? A *whole game*, not a *library* (like SQLite did)?

Currently, announced license terms (GPL for SCP Foundation usage, MIT license for other usage) will remain for SCP: Outrun.

### What about SCP: Site Online?
It has some problems for implementing change, so I suggest to *not* continue SCP: Site Online development, since it may have problems sayed above.
