<!-- title: Site remake -->
## What I am doing now

I recently started learning web development. (I won't leave gamedev for foreseeable future).
This is what I created in <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">small static site generator</a>

## What about upcoming project?

I entered the "development hell" stage. Many models, I have created, are needing a rework, because of bad quality.
Especially the new location, where I misaligned proportions (location is too huge, compared to player size)
