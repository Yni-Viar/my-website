<!-- title: SCP: Containment Procedures release -->
# This SCP-styled simulator finally released
This SCP game includes 6 different SCP and a random facility [using my map generator](https://github.com/Yni-Viar/scp-mapgen-godot).

**You can dowload for Windows, Linux and Android on [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/scpcontpr/998566) and [itch.io](https://yniviar.itch.io/scp-containment-procedures)***

## The backstory
As for now, it will be the last SCP game, because this is the dream, I was keeping since SCP: Site Online (where it was to be implemented, but cancelled).

Yes, I wanted to see in a good SCP game these features:
1. SCP game as an open-source game
    > people forgot, that SCP is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0, and began to make proprietary games
    >(when you use assets under this license, they can be used ONLY with compatible license (such as GNU GPL 3 as for SCP-Wiki CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA 4.0)
    > that's the reason, why Unreal Engine is not compatible with CC-BY-SA), and moreover, some began to use DRM with SCP games, which is forbidden by the license.
2. SCP game as a research game.
    > Most SCP games are about containment breach, which became too common and uninteresting.

I began to make SCP: Containment Procedures based on my older Internal Eternal code, but I eventually stopped, because that concept was too uninteresting.
> In that game, the player just flied from room to room, and because of this behavior, the player could not control all "pawns" at the time.

Later I began the development from empty project, and made SCP: Unstable Dimension (which I stopped supporting right after this game's release).

I came with a new idea, what if re-create SCP: Containment Procedures, but on Unstable Dimension code? And this idea was finished a few days ago.

## The future of this project.

Since I will develop Internal Eternal, I will return to SCP: Containment Procedures not frequently.
As for example, I might try to port SCP-914 mechanic to this game.
